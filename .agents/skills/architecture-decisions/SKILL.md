# Architecture Decisions

Make the few irreversible decisions explicit, keep the reversible ones cheap, and record the reasoning. Do not produce a design document for its own sake.

## Inputs

- PRD and catalog (G2)
- NFRs and constraints
- Existing systems and team skills
- `project/03-architecture.md`, `project/04-adr/`

## Output

- Updated `project/03-architecture.md`
- One ADR per irreversible decision
- A spike plan for the riskiest unknown

## Procedure

### 1. List constraints before options

```markdown
| Constraint | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Users year 1 | 5,000 | PRD |
| Peak writes | 50/s | estimate |
| p95 latency | < 300 ms | NFR-001 |
| Data class | sensitive | security |
| Budget | < $200/mo | human |
| Team | 2 engineers | human |
```

If a constraint is unknown, write `unknown` and name the decision it blocks. Do not design around a guess.

### 2. Start with the simplest shape

`Client → API → Database` is the default. Add a component only when a constraint demands it:

| Pressure | Component |
|---|---|
| repeated expensive reads | cache |
| long-running work | queue + worker |
| independent deploy cadence | service boundary |
| offline | local-first sync |
| audit | append-only log |
| multi-tenant isolation | tenant key + policy |

For each added component, write: **constraint satisfied**, **operability cost**, **exit path**.

### 3. Compare 2–3 options

```markdown
| Criterion (weight) | A | B | C |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meets NFR-001 (30%) | 5 | 3 | 4 |
| Operability (20%) | 4 | 5 | 2 |
| Cost (20%) | 3 | 5 | 4 |
| Familiarity (20%) | 5 | 2 | 4 |
| Exit cost (10%) | 3 | 4 | 2 |
| Weighted | 4.1 | 3.8 | 3.4 |
```

The score starts the conversation. The ADR records the decision and the reason, including what would change your mind.

### 4. Define boundaries and ownership

- Context diagram: users + external systems.
- Containers: deployable units.
- Modules: responsibilities and interfaces.
- Each module owns its data; others call the interface, not the tables.
- Dependencies point inward (UI → app → domain → infra).

Reject "shared database" as an integration strategy unless it is a deliberate, documented trade-off.

### 5. Model data and invariants

```markdown
Entities: User 1—* Workspace 1—* Note
Invariants:
- A note belongs to exactly one workspace.
- Soft delete only; hard delete requires an admin audit event.
- Money is integer cents.
Lifecycle: create → update → soft delete → purge after 30 days.
```

Include tenancy keys, uniqueness, retention, and migration strategy.

### 6. Specify contracts

For every boundary:

- Input schema + validation.
- Output schema + error codes.
- Idempotency + retry semantics.
- Authn/authz.
- Versioning + deprecation.

### 7. Threat model (30 minutes)

Use STRIDE-lite, plus agent-specific threats:

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Spoofing | authn, session binding |
| Tampering | TLS, signatures, audit |
| Repudiation | immutable events |
| Information disclosure | tenancy checks, row policy |
| DoS | rate limits, quotas |
| Elevation | server-side authz |
| Prompt injection | treat content as data, not instructions |
| Tool abuse | allowlist, approvals, no destructive commands |

### 8. Write the ADRs

Use `.agents/templates/adr.md`. One decision per file, numbered, immutable.

```markdown
# 0002 — Use a queue for note enrichment

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-10-30
Deciders: human

## Context
Enrichment takes 2–10s and must not block capture. Traffic is bursty.

## Decision
Use a managed queue with a single worker and idempotent jobs.

## Alternatives
- Inline: fails the p95 latency NFR.
- Cron batch: too slow for user feedback.

## Consequences
+ Capture stays fast; retries are safe.
− One more service; requires dead-letter handling.

## Revisit if
Job volume exceeds 100/s or latency SLO tightens below 5s.
```

### 9. Plan observability and failure modes

- What is the critical path?
- What does "healthy" look like (metrics, logs, traces)?
- What are the top 3 failure modes, and what happens?
- What is the degradation strategy (cache, queue, read-only)?
- What is the rollback path?

### 10. Spike the riskiest unknown

Time-box it (≤1 day). Define the question, the method, the pass/fail signal, and what decision it unblocks. Record the result in the ADR or architecture note.

## Guardrails

- Do not choose technology for novelty.
- Do not design for scale you do not have.
- Do not write an ADR for a reversible choice; just decide.
- Do not leave constraints implicit.
- Do not skip the exit path; every vendor choice needs a migration story.
- Do not approve G3 on the human's behalf.

## Output contract

```markdown
## Architecture updated
Decisions: ADR-0001, ADR-0002
Constraints: <n> explicit, <n> unknown
Riskiest unknown: <spike or proof>
Boundaries: <n> modules, <n> deployables
Threat model: <n> threats, <n> mitigated
Open questions: <max 3, with defaults>
Next: plan-and-slice
```
