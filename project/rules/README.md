# Project rules

Project-specific constraints that are too detailed for `AGENTS.md` and too important to bury in a doc.

## When to add a rule

- A convention the agent cannot infer from the code.
- A hard constraint from compliance, billing, or a past incident.
- A "never touch" path or system.
- A domain invariant that must hold across features.

Do not add generic advice ("write clean code"). It costs tokens and changes nothing.

## Format

One file per topic, ≤20 bullets, testable:

```markdown
# project/rules/billing.md
- Money is integer cents; never floats.
- Every mutation writes an audit event.
- Prices are server-side; the client never sends a price.
```

Use `.agents/templates/rule.md`.

## Loading

Rules here are **not** loaded automatically. The agent reads the relevant file, as directed by `AGENTS.md` §9 or a task/spec. Add a rule to `AGENTS.md` §11 only if breaking it is catastrophic and it must be known every session.
