description: Use when writing, changing, fixing, or refactoring product code, running tests, or completing a task from the plan. Enforces a small-diff, verify-first loop.

# Implementation Loop

The default behavior for code changes: read the task, prove the behavior, make the smallest change, verify, review, commit.

## Inputs

- One task file (`project/05-plan/tasks/T-###.md`) or an executable work order
- The linked spec and ADRs
- The files named in the task (only those)

## Procedure

### 1. Confirm the contract

Read the task and spec. In one or two internal lines, state:

> Done means: `<acceptance 1>`, `<acceptance 2>`, and `<regression>`.

If acceptance is missing or ambiguous, stop and run `prompt-optimizer`. Do not guess.

### 2. Establish a baseline

Run the relevant checks **before** editing:

```bash
<install if needed>
<test command for the touched area>
```

If the baseline is red, record it. Do not attribute pre-existing failures to your change.

### 3. Locate the pattern

- `rg "<symbol>"` to find siblings.
- Read the closest existing implementation and its tests.
- Read only the files you will touch plus their direct dependencies.
- Check `project/04-adr/` and `project/rules/` for constraints.

Do not explore the whole repo "for context".

### 4. Prove the behavior first

Write or identify the check that should fail:

- New behavior → a failing test.
- Bug → a failing regression test.
- Refactor → existing tests must stay green.
- Perf → a benchmark with a threshold.
- Docs → a link/format check.

Run it and confirm it fails for the right reason. If it passes, the test is wrong or the behavior already exists.

### 5. Make the smallest change

- Touch the minimum number of files.
- Follow the existing pattern.
- No drive-by refactors, formatting, or renames.
- No new dependencies unless the task requires and justifies them.
- Keep the diff reviewable in one sitting.

If the change needs a schema migration, a new dependency, or a public API change, stop and confirm with the human.

### 6. Verify in layers

```bash
# 1. targeted
<test command> <path-or-name>

# 2. affected package
<package test>

# 3. full fast suite
<lint && typecheck && test>
```

Report exact commands and results. Never claim a check passed without running it.

### 7. Self-review the diff

```bash
git diff
git diff --staged
```

Check:

- [ ] Acceptance met, one by one.
- [ ] No unrelated changes.
- [ ] Error paths handled.
- [ ] Authz checked server-side.
- [ ] No secrets, debug logs, or dead code.
- [ ] Tests assert behavior, not mocks.
- [ ] Docs/state updated.
- [ ] Diff is understandable without a call.

If the diff is large or messy, split it before committing.

### 8. Commit one logical change

```bash
git status
git add <explicit paths>
git commit -m "feat(scope): imperative summary" -m "Why this change is needed.

Refs: FEAT-###, T-###"
```

Do not `git add .`. Do not commit generated files. Do not commit if checks are red.

### 9. Update state

- Task status → done.
- Catalog status → in-progress/shipped as appropriate.
- `project/STATE.md` next action.
- If you learned something durable, update the spec/ADR.

### 10. Stop

Stop when acceptance is met and checks are green. Do not add polish, extra tests, or speculative features.

## Failure protocol

| Attempt | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 fails | Read the full error. Fix the actual cause. |
| 2 fails | Re-read the relevant code and the test. Question the assumption. |
| 3 fails | Stop. Report: what you tried, the exact error, your hypothesis, and the smallest question for the human. |

Do not weaken a test, catch and ignore an error, or disable a check to get green.

## Context protocol

- If the session reaches ~60% of the window, write a handoff and start fresh.
- Handoff: state, decisions, next action, open questions, relevant files.
- Do not carry exploration from a previous task into a new one.

## Guardrails

- No full-file rewrites when a targeted edit works.
- No unrelated formatting or import churn.
- No speculative abstraction or config.
- No new dependency without justification.
- No commit without a green targeted check.
- No push, merge, or rebase unless the human asks.

## Output contract

```markdown
## T-### — <title>
Changed: <files>
Why: <one line>
Verification: <commands + result>
Acceptance: <n>/<n>
Risk: <low/med/high + note>
Commit: <sha or "not committed">
Next: <one action>
```
