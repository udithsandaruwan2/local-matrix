# Plan and Slice

Turn a product baseline and architecture into a short sequence of **demoable vertical slices**. The plan exists to buy information early, not to predict the future.

## Inputs

- `project/02-product-catalog.md`
- `project/03-architecture.md` and ADRs
- `project/05-plan.md` (if it exists)
- Team capacity and deadline

## Output

- Updated `project/05-plan.md`
- `project/05-plan/tasks/T-###-<slug>.md` for every task
- `project/STATE.md` updated to phase 4 / next action

## Procedure

### 1. Define 3–5 outcome milestones

A milestone is a demonstrable state:

```markdown
## M1 — Capture works
Outcome: a signed-in user can create, reload, and see a note.
Demo: create a note, refresh, note is still there.
Exit: E2E green, staging deployed, no P0.
```

Avoid "backend 50%" or "sprint 3". If you cannot demo it, it is not a milestone.

### 2. Slice vertically

Each slice crosses UI, logic, and data for one user outcome:

```markdown
| ID | Task | Size | Depends | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-001 | notes table + migration | S | — | todo |
| T-002 | POST /notes + validation | S | T-001 | todo |
| T-003 | capture form + optimistic save | M | T-002 | todo |
| T-004 | E2E: empty, valid, offline | M | T-003 | todo |
```

Do not group by layer ("all models", "all endpoints"). That hides integration risk until the end.

### 3. Size each task

| Size | Files | Time | Planning |
|---|---|---|---|
| S | 1–2 | <30 min | none |
| M | 3–8 | 0.5–2 h | 3–8 lines |
| L | 9–20 | 2–6 h | written plan + slices |
| XL | >20 | >1 day | **split** |

If a task is XL, split by user outcome or risk. Never put an XL task in the plan.

### 4. Write task files

Use `.agents/templates/task.md`:

```markdown
# T-003 — Capture form

Goal: submit a note from the main screen in ≤3 actions.
Size: M. Risk: medium.

Context:
- FEAT-001 spec
- src/notes/form.tsx (pattern)
- T-002 API contract

Acceptance:
- [ ] Enter submits; Shift+Enter adds a newline
- [ ] empty submit shows inline error, no request
- [ ] optimistic note appears before the response
- [ ] failure restores the draft and shows retry

Out of scope: editing, sharing, rich text.
Verification: pnpm test notes; pnpm lint; manual offline.
Dependencies: T-002.
```

One page max. If it needs more, split.

### 5. Sequence by risk and dependency

1. Fatal unknowns → spike first.
2. Critical path → what blocks the most work.
3. Fast feedback → what lets you test the product soonest.
4. Polish → last.

Make the critical path visible. Mark tasks that can run in parallel with disjoint files.

### 6. Estimate with ranges

```markdown
| Task | Size | Confidence | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-001 | S | high | pattern exists |
| T-003 | M | medium | offline behavior unclear |
```

Low confidence → add a spike before implementation.

### 7. Add buffers visibly

- Known work: sum of task ranges.
- Integration/review: +20–30%.
- Interruptions: +10–20%.
- Release: 1–2 days.

Do not inflate estimates to hide the buffer.

### 8. Define the first slice

It must be:

- End-to-end, even if ugly.
- Deployable to staging.
- Covered by at least one automated test.
- Demoable in under 5 minutes.
- At most 3 tasks.

If not, cut scope until it is.

### 9. Plan review and release

For each milestone:

- Reviewer and review scope.
- Required checks.
- Rollback plan.
- Docs to update.
- Release window.

### 10. Update state and hand off

```yaml
phase: 5-build
gates:
  G4: approved 2026-10-30 by human
next_action: "Implement T-001 (notes table + migration)"
```

Then use `implementation-loop` for the first task.

## Guardrails

- No XL tasks.
- No horizontal slices.
- No date-based milestones without a demo.
- No parallel tasks that touch the same files.
- No task without acceptance and verification.
- Do not plan more than one milestone in detail; later milestones will change.

## Output contract

```markdown
## Plan updated
Milestones: <n>
Tasks: <n> (S/M/L/XL = ...)
First slice: T-### → T-### → T-###
Parallel-safe: <task IDs>
Critical path: <task IDs>
Risks: <top 3>
Next: implement T-###
```
