# Spec Writer

Write the smallest spec that makes behavior unambiguous and testable. A spec is a contract, not a design document.

## Inputs

- `project/02-prd.md` and the catalog entry (`FEAT-###`)
- Relevant ADRs and project rules
- Existing specs in `project/06-specs/` for format consistency

## Output

`project/06-specs/FEAT-###-<slug>.md` using `.agents/templates/feature-spec.md`.

Target: **under 300 lines**. If it is longer, split the feature.

## Procedure

### 1. State the contract

```markdown
## Summary
<one paragraph: who, what, why>

## Non-goals
- <explicit exclusion>

## User story
As a <role>, I want <capability>, so that <outcome>.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Given <context>, when <action>, then <observable result>.
```

If you cannot write the user story, the feature is not defined.

### 2. Define behavior, not implementation

Describe what the system does, not which class does it. Leave architecture to the ADRs.

Cover:

- Happy path.
- Empty / first-use state.
- Invalid input.
- Permission denied.
- Network failure / timeout.
- Concurrent or repeated action.
- Limits (size, count, rate).

### 3. Write testable acceptance

One bullet = one check. Use Given/When/Then for flows, thresholds for NFRs.

| Weak | Strong |
|---|---|
| "Handles errors" | "On 500, shows retry and preserves the draft" |
| "Fast" | "p95 < 300 ms at 10k records" |
| "Secure" | "A non-member receives 403 and no data" |
| "Mobile friendly" | "Usable at 360×640 without horizontal scroll" |

If a bullet needs "and", split it.

### 4. Define the data and state

- Entities and fields touched.
- State machine: states, transitions, invalid transitions.
- Idempotency: what happens on retry.
- Deletion: soft/hard, retention.

### 5. Define the interfaces

For each API/event/UI contract:

- Input schema + validation.
- Output schema.
- Error codes and user-visible messages.
- Auth requirements.
- Versioning impact.

### 6. Add examples

Use concrete examples, not abstract descriptions:

```json
// POST /notes
{ "body": "Buy milk" }

// 201
{ "id": "n_123", "body": "Buy milk", "created_at": "2026-10-30T10:00:00Z" }

// 400
{ "error": { "code": "EMPTY_BODY", "message": "Write something first." } }
```

### 7. Map to tests

```markdown
| Acceptance | Test |
|---|---|
| empty body rejected | integration: POST "" → 400 |
| draft survives reload | E2E: offline → type → reload |
| non-member forbidden | authz: outsider → 403 |
```

Every acceptance item needs a check. If it cannot be automated, write the manual steps.

### 8. Update the catalog

Set the feature status to `specified` and link the spec path. Do not change priority without the human.

### 9. Review for ambiguity

Ask:

- Could two engineers build different things from this?
- Is every error path defined?
- Is every limit numeric?
- Is anything in scope that is not in the catalog?
- Is there a non-goal for every tempting adjacent feature?

## Guardrails

- Do not include implementation details unless they are constraints.
- Do not invent product decisions; ask with a default.
- Do not write a spec for an XL feature; split it first.
- Do not duplicate the PRD; link to it.
- Do not add acceptance criteria the user did not agree to.
- Keep IDs stable and unique.

## Output contract

```markdown
## Spec drafted
Path: project/06-specs/FEAT-###-<slug>.md
Acceptance: <n> checks
Tests mapped: <n>/<n>
Catalog: FEAT-### → specified
Open questions: <max 3, with defaults>
Next: review, then plan-and-slice
```
